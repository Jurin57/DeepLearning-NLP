The raw data file contains two text files: comments categorized as complaints are in "neg", and those categorized as non-complaints are in "pos".
The "sentiment analysis" file contains the code for my text preprocessing, modeling, and the application of the model for prediction.
The test data file include my identified non-complaint tweets. Given the probabilisitc nature, I sorted them in decreasing order of my confidence.
